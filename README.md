# Flair only on certain days bot
This is a Reddit bot for only allowing certain post flairs on certain days.
If a post with the specified flair is posted on the wrong day, it will be removed with the given message.

Credit goes to [epicmindwarp](https://github.com/epicmindwarp) for writing the initial version of this bot.
Also credit to [rezl](https://github.com/rezl) for extending it and writing this README.

# Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- praw 6.3.1+

# How to Host the Bot on Heroku
The main advantage of Heroku is their base plan includes enough hours to host this bot for free. This guide assumes youâ€™re using Windows and this bot's code, but should work for getting a general Reddit bot running on Heroku as well. 

# Setup Git
1. [Create a Github account.](https://github.com/join) 

2. [Assuming you're reading this on the repo page](https://github.com/jackodsteel/SubmissionStatementBot), select â€˜forkâ€™ to create a copy of it to your Github account. 

3. From your new repo, select **Clone or download** and then **Download ZIP** to download a local copy. Weâ€™ll come back to this later.

4. Make note of (copy/paste somewhere) your Reddit appâ€™s Client ID. This the string directly under **personal use script**. This is your Reddit App Client ID.

5. Make note of (copy/paste somewhere) the URL linking to your repo (e.g. https://github.com/yourusername/collapse). This is your Github Repo URL.

6. [Go here and install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you donâ€™t have it already.


# Setup Heroku
1. Create a Heroku account. This is the service which will be running the bot.

2. Once created, create a new Heroku app.

3. Add an app name and select **create app**

4. On the following page (Deploy) make sure Deployment method is set to **Heroku Git** (should be by default)

5. Click the **Settings** tab to go to your appâ€™s settings page. Make note of  (copy/paste somewhere)  the Heroku git URL, weâ€™ll need it later. This is your Heroku Git URL.

6. Click the **Deploy** tab to load up the Deploy Instructions. Keep this open for later.

7. Install Heroku SLI. This will allow us to manage the app via a terminal.


# Setup Reddit
1. [Create a new Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/register/?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2F) with the name youâ€™d like for your bot.

2. Login into your primary Reddit account which moderates your subreddit.

3. Go to https://old.reddit.com/r/YOURSUBREDDIT/about/moderators/ and invite the bot to become a moderator with full permissions.

4. Log back into the botâ€™s account and accept the invitation.

5. Go to https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ and select **Create and app**

6. Type a name for your app and choose **script**.

7. Write a short description of what your bot will be doing.

8. Set the **about URI** to your Github Repo URL.

9. Set the **redirect URI** to your Heroku Git URL. 

10. Select **create app**.

11. Make note of the secret code for the next steps.


# Configure the Bot
1. Take the local copy of your repo and extract it to wherever youâ€™d like it to live on your machine. I put it at the root of my hard drive (e.g. c:/mybot) so I donâ€™t have to type out a longer path once weâ€™re in the terminal, but it's just personal preference.

2. Open **bot.py**

3. Change `ENTER_YOUR_SUBREDDIT_NAME` to your subâ€™s name. 

4. Set the `MEME_REMOVAL_REPLY` text to whatever youâ€™d like the bot to comment after removing a post

5. Save the file.

6. Open **config.py** and fill in these fields with your info. Make sure not to remove the apostrophes surrounding them.
```
username = 'BotRedditUsername'
password = 'BotRedditPassword'
client_id = 'RedditAppClientID'
client_secret = 'RedditAppSecret'
```
7. Save the file.


# Upload the Bot
1. Open **Git Bash** (Windows key, then type `Git Bash`).

2. Type `heroku login` in the terminal. This will open a browser window and have you login to Heroku. The terminal should say youâ€™re logged in now. If it hangs, [try this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55955948/heroku-login-success-but-then-freezes). The next commands you're need to enter can also be referenced in the Deploy tab on the Heroku site.
```
$ cd c:folderyourbotisin

$ git init

$ heroku git:remote -a yourbotname

$ git add .

$ git commit -am "make it better"

$ git push heroku master
````
3. Once it is it done deploying go to back to the Heroku page.

4. Select the **Resources** tab.

5. Click the pen icon next to **worker python bot.py**

6. Click the toggle to the left of the pen to activate the process. It should turn blue.

7. Click confirm. This will start running the bot process.

8. Select **More** and **View logs**

9. You should now see the bot in action. You can check your subreddit to see whatever changes it made (if any) as well as make a test post to ensure it's working properly.


# Upgrade your Heroku hours
Optional: go to the Heroku billing page (https://dashboard.heroku.com/account/billing) and add a credit card to your account. 
Heroku limits the number of hours they will run your bot each month. This can be increased by attaching a credit card to the account. This bot will not use up itâ€™s free monthly allowance, but will not have enough free hours without a card attached.
